# kai3-dev-environment

Follow the instructions here:

This repo contains an AppImage for `Firefox Nightly 84.0a1 (2020-10-28) (64-bit)` this is so that you don't have to do complicated installs of outdated Firefox versions.

Just use appscmd, and test the apps using the simulator.

I think KaiOS 3.0 documentation is very scarce. For information related on how to actually make apps for v3, check out [arma7x's work](https://github.com/arma7x/) and [kaios.dev](https://kaios.dev/).
